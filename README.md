# Hack Emulator

`hemu` is an emulator for the Hack computer architecture implemented in Rust.

# Status

Got code execution going! The emulator can process basic programs which only make use of the registers, memory, and the Alu, such as a calculator storing its results in memory. There are still a few bugs left to fix before it will be emulating the Cpu exactly, and the emulator still needs keyboard input and a way to visualise the screen.
